# Swap Overview

CMswap is a decentralized digital asset exchange protocol designed with a focus on efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Built on the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model and powered by Uniswap V3 infrastructure, CMswap significantly enhances capital efficiency, improves liquidity provisioning, and reduces slippage and trading fees for users.

## The Differences Between CMswap and Traditional AMMs

CMswap adopts the Concentrated Liquidity model, similar to Uniswap V3, allowing liquidity providers to allocate capital within specific price ranges rather than across the entire curve. This approach enables the following benefits:

✅ Enhanced Liquidity Efficiency – Capital is utilized more effectively, maximizing the return on liquidity.

✅ Reduced Trading Slippage – Market prices become more stable, improving the overall trading experience.

✅ Flexible Profit Strategies – Liquidity providers can implement strategies tailored to their individual risk preferences.

## Core Components of CMswap

1. Liquidity Provider (LP) – Price Range-Based Liquidity Provision
LPs can specify the price range within which they want their liquidity to be active.
The system calculates fees based on the selected range, and LPs earn fees from trades executed within those price bounds.

2. Order Routing – Efficient Trade Matching
CMswap utilizes an algorithmic mechanism to identify the most efficient trading routes across multiple liquidity pools, ensuring optimal execution for users.

3. Fee Tiers – Flexible Fee Structure
LPs can choose fee tiers based on the characteristics of the assets they support.
Higher-risk or more volatile assets may incur higher fees to compensate for the increased exposure.
